	<p>You are a Mimic, an alien that made it's way on to the station.</p>
	<p>Mimics can break down doors and structures easily.</p>
	<p>You can copy the form of any item you can see by clicking on it.</p>
	<p>You can undisguise by clicking on yourself.</p>
	<p>You can <b>latch</b> onto people by attacking them. While disguised, <b>latching is instant</b>.</p>
	<p>When you're latched onto someone, they won't be able to deal any damage to you, but you will be able to attack them.</p>
	<p>After you kill someone, you can <b>absorb</b> their corpse by clicking on it, then <b>replicate</b> with the button at the top.</p>
	<p>Your objective is to spread the mimics to as much of the station as possible.</p>
